 * MDC keys used when injecting the current trace/span id into log entries.

 * This mirrors the constants from the alpha `io.opentelemetry.instrumentation.api.incubator.log.LoggingContextConstants`
 * class. It is duplicated locally so this project can depend on stable OpenTelemetry artifacts
 * (`opentelemetry-api`/`opentelemetry-context`) instead of the alpha `opentelemetry-instrumentation-api-incubator`
 * module, which is only pulled in transitively by the (also alpha) `opentelemetry-ktor-3.0` instrumentation library.
